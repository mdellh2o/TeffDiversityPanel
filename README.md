Here we store and share scripts used to conduct data analysis in Woldeyohannes, Iohannes et al. eLife 2022;0:e80009 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80009)
The script collection is mostly in R but some routines are conducted in bash. All details are given in scripts. Data needed to conduct the analyses can be found associated to the paper and as follows: teff accessions are available upon request from the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute (EBI, http://www.ebi.gov.et/). Raw DNA sequencing reads are available on the Short Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) under BioProject accession number PRJNA758057.
