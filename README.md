Here we store and share scripts used to conduct data analysis in Wodelyohannes et al 2021 (NNN).
The script collection is mostly in R but some routines are conducted in bash. All details are given in scripts.
Data needed to conduct the analyses can be found associated to the paper and in NNN.
Lead author of the scripts can be contacted at l.caproni (at) santannapisa.it
